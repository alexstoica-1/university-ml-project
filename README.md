## Project Task (Summary)
The initial task was to:
- Work with a given dataset in `mldata_0003260547`.
- Understand and analyze the provided data structure and features.
- Build, train, and evaluate deep learning models to solve the problem defined by the dataset.
- Compare different approaches and document observations.
